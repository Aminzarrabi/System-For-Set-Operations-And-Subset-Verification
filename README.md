# 🧮 System for Set Operations and Subset Verification (C++)

This project is a **C++ system for performing mathematical set operations** using **operator overloading**.  
It supports operations on two sets of characters (or numbers represented as characters), including union, intersection, difference, Cartesian product, power set generation, and subset verification.

The project was implemented as a **final-term academic project** and focuses on object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

## 🚀 Features
- Set union
- Set intersection
- Set difference
- Cartesian product of two sets
- Power set generation
- Subset verification
- Input/output stream overloading

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Operator Overloading
- Friend Functions
- STL (`string`, `iostream`)
- Bitwise operations for power set generation

## ➕ Supported Operations

| Operator | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `+` | Union of two sets |
| `*` | Intersection of two sets |
| `-` | Difference of two sets |
| `/` | Subset check |
| `^` | Cartesian product |
| `+=` | Power set generation |
| `>>` | Input stream overloading |
| `<<` | Output stream overloading |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o set_system
